## What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code is an AI-powered command-line tool that acts as your pair programmer, helping you build, debug, and improve code through natural conversation.**

Instead of manually writing every line of code, you describe what you want to accomplish, and Claude Code helps you implement it. It can read your files, make edits, run commands, search the web, and much more - all while explaining what it's doing.

## Key Concepts for Beginners

### What is "AI Pair Programming"?

> **AI Pair Programming** is working alongside AI to build software. Instead of writing every line of code yourself, you describe what you want, and AI helps implement it. It's like having an expert developer sitting next to you, ready to help with any task.

### Understanding the CLI (Command Line Interface)

Claude Code runs in your terminal. Don't be intimidated! We'll teach you everything you need to know.

### How Claude Code Works

1. **You:** Describe what you want to build or change
2. **Claude Code:** Analyzes your request and asks clarifying questions if needed
3. **AI Assistant:** Uses tools to read files, write code, run commands
4. **You:** Review the changes and provide feedback
5. **Repeat:** Iterate until you have what you want

### Tools Explained Simply

- **Read** → "Show me this file"
- **Write** → "Create this new file"
- **Edit** → "Change this specific part"
- **Bash** → "Run this command"
- **Task** → "Handle this complex task"
- **Grep** → "Find this text in my code"

---
